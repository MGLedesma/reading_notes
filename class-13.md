What is Virtualization?
- “Virtualization is the creation of a virtual, rather than actual, version of something.” (Virtualization, 2017).
- hypervisor acts as a virtual machine manager that sits on top of the host system.

“In summary, cloud computing leverages virtualization technology to achieve the goal of providing computing resources as a utility.” (Zhang, Cheng, and Boutaba, 2010).
